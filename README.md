## Introduction
This is a homework project for module 3: Debugging in HFY, with a focus on JavaScript. This is a collaboration project in which each of collaborators takes part in solving the mystery of JavaScript in this project.  
**Starter Code** means that half of the codes are already written and we need to complete it so that the project can run properly. 

### What are the goals?
This project assignment has two main goals: **integrating (using together html, css with JavaSCipt) and debugging goals**, which are:
* to analyse the codes: detect some errors or missing parts from the JavaScript codes
* to fix the codes: complete the missing parts or replace some errors found with the correct codes
* to do self-test, one by one, on the project through some browser debuggers or in JS Tutor 

### Who should do it?
* Anyone who is interested in Debugging
* Beginners in JavaScript, using function.
