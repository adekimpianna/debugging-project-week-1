# Development Strategy

> **Debugging Project Week 1**

There is nothing special about the design from this project because we are focusing on the javascript. However to see the connection among HTML, CSS and Javascript, it is necessary to create at least a way on the structure, such as HTML elements, to ensure the JavaScript code can be run through, and here we use `button` for that.
